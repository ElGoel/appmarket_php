# Project PHP8 

Hi!, this is a project built-in with a Model View Controller architecture. from scratch I create a pseudo-framework that helps to get a dynamic and easy to maintain and update, I use PHP and MySQL for the Back-End of the Project and HTML/Scss/JavaScript for the Front-End with the use of Gulp for the compiler.

this project is mainly to be a maker of dates for services, with an admin and a client session for each of them.
